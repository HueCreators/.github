# Hue Studios

### Infrastructure Overview

As of most recent updates, the entire strategic underpinning and intricate mechanics of hue studio operations is designed to attain theoretically the pinnacle levels of data security and privacy. The operational model correlates with the fundamentals employed in Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) employed in blockchain technology.

To elucidate further, the underlying principles are set in such a manner that no human intervention is required or permissible in directly accessing databases or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The spectrum of this directive covers Random Access Memory (RAM) and storage tampering.

Moreover, the system stands fully autonomous, on the regards of data sharing and establishing connection with newly designed servers. This negates the need for a single controlling entity, converging all instances into platforms that can not only interact among each other, but can also conduct inter-inspection, enveloping full OS monitoring.

The implications stand thus, that every instance will uphold transparency and expectations among each other, and act up vigilantly on finding any instances in discord. In addition, the system holds the capability to thoroughly scan any future updates to the APIs source code, and ensure no unauthorized dispatch of data occurs without proper initialisation.

Adding more to the comprehensive security, no single instance will hold all the stored data. The database will be disintegrated and backups decentralized, scattered over the entire infrastructure. This implies that for any unauthorized access to complete data, one would have to infect all machines simultaneously.

### Privacy Statement

Our commitment to privacy of data stands unwavering and perpetual. De facto measures are in place to ensure minimalistic tracking of user data, strictly to the imperatives of security enforcement.

Here are some general examples of the data collection:

**Device Data:**
- Incorporates general fingerprinting of your system via browser.

**Connection Statistics:**
- Mitigate unwelcome activities via the same Virtual Private Network (VPN) servers.

**Behavioural Activity:**
- Includes specific service behaviour for analytics and prevention of unlawful actions.
