# Fractured

Fractured is an innovative online communication platform. It supports interaction through various channels, such as messaging and communities, while prioritizing user privacy and data confidentiality. 

— It gives users the liberty to join, interact and share content within a variety of communities, while also providing opportunities for customizations through plugins.

— Now, let's look at what Fractured offers its users — both free and premium, and its communities.

## Free Users:

- Can cross-share emojis, including animated ones.
- Can join up to 30 communities. (This limit will increase as we grow.)
- Have access to one plugin made by us.

## Premium Users (~$7/month):

- Have all the benefits of free users.
- Can join up to 200 communities.
- Get access to the public marketplace for other client-side plugins, which are completely free.
- Can use action-specific avatars, including animated ones.
- 10% of the monthly cost will be equally distributed to plugin developers, excluding ours. It's divided by plugin, not developer.
- An additional 10% is equally distributed each month to any premium community they belong to.

## Free Communities:

- Can accommodate up to 100 members. (This limit will increase as we grow.)
- Have access to five plugins made by us.
- Can use up to 20 emojis, both animated and non-animated combined. (The quantity of emojis will increase over time.)

## Premium Communities (~$7/month):

- Have access to the public marketplace for other community-side plugins, which are entirely free.
- Get a permanent vanity link after manual verification.
- Get a permanent spot in the community browser.
- Can use up to 100 emojis.

# Plugins & Microtransactions:

- Plugins can modify the UI, create new channel types, add messages, enable auto-translations, and much more.
- Any NPM package can be used as long as it's pre-approved.
- Plugins won't be able to connect to the internet unless certain URLs have been pre-approved.
- In production, plugin developers won't have access to the databases where plugins store their data.
- Plugins must be free out of the box - they won't be allowed to contain any microtransactions, except a donation button.
- Communities and users can post a "Wanted" listing for a specific plugin and attach a price tag to it. (This is the only acceptable form of microtransaction.)

At Fractured, **we treat the privacy of our users seriously.**

- Information like your full name, address, and age will stay confidential and will only be used if required by law for payment processes.
- Any content you submit is classified into three separate categories:

   1. **Direct Messages**: All direct messages or group chats use the Signal protocol for maximum privacy. We do not see any messages therein. You can search for "Signal Protocol" for more information.
   2. **Private Communities**: The only information we possess in this regard is about the channels.
   3. **Public Communities**: In addition to channel information, we also have access to community information provided by you, used in the "community browser". The key difference between private and public communities is that public communities have plugins.

# Plugins:

- As established earlier, plugins execute directly on the same server as the community.
- Developers will not have access to any data accumulated in the plugin database during production.
- Plugins can request access to specific URLs for external data, but this request comes under heavy scrutiny to ensure no user or database information is transmitted.

**Fractured does not collect any information directly.** However, should a user report a particular message, we will be able to see its content. Moreover, our support team will have access to personal information required for payment proceedings, like your full name, address, and age, but only if there's a dispute with the payment processor or you.
